Cook-a-Dream wraps an interactive, user-friendly interface around “deep dreaming” or “inceptionism”. It aims to unleash the creative and pedagogical potentials of deep dreaming for non-technical users.

Deep Dreaming uses Artificial Intelligence to create or modify images. It optimizes images to “superexcite” certain parts of an artificial neural network specialized in recognizing categories of objects. The process compares to dreaming, or maybe to visual hallucinations in humans.

**The results of deep dreaming are unpredictable** and may at times be beautiful or repulsive, inspiring or disturbing, humorous or offensive.
